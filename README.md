# VertX Game Engine

## Description

The following repository was created to host the creation of the **VertX Game Engine**, made during our 3rd year Game Engines university course at CITM-UPC. Please go to section **Controls** for Engine Controls, and **Features** to see the latest updates to functionality.
 
This game engine has been made in **C/C++** programming language, and also using the following **3rd party libraries**:

- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)
- [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org/)
- [GLEW](https://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/)
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- [Assimp](https://assimp.org/)
- [DevIL](https://openil.sourceforge.net/)
